My own Dvorak-like layout
=========================

This is the Dvorak-like keyboard layout I am using on my machines. It
is somewhat optimised for Hungarian and programming. It contains
various accented letters for my other needs, like Icelandic and
Turkish input, and many dead keys to enter other accented letters.

Convert from X11 to kbd

    ckbcomp hu dvorak > hu-102_dvorak_dead.map

`ckbcomp` is in the console-setup package both in Fedora and Ubuntu.
